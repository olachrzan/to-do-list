# âœ… To Do List  
This website is a to-do list that was further developed as a new [repository](https://github.com/olachrzan/to_do_list_react).

You can add new tasks and they will be displayed below.<br>A great facilitation is that after saving a task, focus stays on the input, so you can enter several tasks in a row.<br>Saved tasks can be marked as done by clicking the green button (then they will be crossed out) or they can be deleted by clicking the red button.<br>It's also possible to interact on several buttons at once - you can hide/show completed tasks or mark all tasks as done.
