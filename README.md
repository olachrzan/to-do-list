# âœ… To Do List  
This website is a to-do list. You can add new tasks and they will be displayed below.<br>A great facilitation is that after saving a task, focus stays on the input, so you can enter several tasks in a row.<br>Saved tasks can be marked as done by clicking the green button (then they will be crossed out) or they can be deleted by clicking the red button.
